<h4 id="cap">Choosing the right Swimming caps</h4>
<p>A swim cap is an important part of many swimmers workout attire. Swim caps are worn for many purposes: to protect your hair from chlorine, keep your hair from tangling, to help streamline you as you swim, to insulate the top of your head when in cold water, during an open water swim to make you visible, or can be worn simply as a fashion item to make a statement with a printed logo or have your cap match your swim suit.</p>
<p>There are several major types of swim caps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<b>LATEX RACING CAPS</b> are the most popular type of swim cap. They are named for the latex rubber material used in their construction. Latex caps are very popular because they provide good protection from the water and are extremely inexpensive. They are available in a wide variety of colors, and can be printed with neat designs or team names. They are very streamlined and make you more slippery in the water. And because they fit very tight to the head, when you pull them down and wear them over your ears they provide relatively good protection from the water, keeping water off of most of your hair and out of your ears.</li>
	
	<li><b>SILICONE CAPS</b> are a heavier weight material than latex, so these caps are much more durable than the standard latex racing cap (some swimmers get years of use from their silicone caps when rinsed properly after each swim) . Silicone caps have a slippery touch, so they do not pull your hair as much as other caps when you take 	the cap off of your head.</li>
	
	<li><b>LYCRA CAPS</b> are made of the same lycra® brand spandex as swim suits are. Consequently they will keep no water out of your hair. Lycra® caps are worn by people who want to keep the hair in place (and out of eyes and ears) and prevent their hair from being tangled on shoulder straps. Some swimmers wear these caps under a latex racing cap to reduce hair pulling when the swimmer takes their cap off. Also, since these caps are made from the same Lycra® as swim suits, it is possible to find a lycra swim cap that matches swimsuit colors for a fully coordinated outfit.</li>
	
	<li><b>INSULATED CAPS</b> help keep your head warm when swimming in cold water. The Barracuda Hot head cap has thick insulated construction and covers the full head and ears. These caps also usually are worn in a bright orange color which provides visibility when you are swimming in open waters.</li>
	
	<li><b>STRAP CAPS</b> are a solid molded rubber cap with molded ear flaps and a strap that fits under the chin. This strap helps keep the cap in place, and helps keep the ear flaps down to keep water away from the ears and hair. Very traditional looking, these caps are extremely popular and are great sellers.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="goggles">Choosing the right Swimming goggles:</h4>
<p>Prolonged exposure to chlorine can cause start to eat away at the corneal surface of the eye. This may cause itchy, irritated eyes, or temporary blindness.Contact lens wearers fear the loss of contact lenses, and often swim their eyes closed. If you wear a goggle, you can open your eyes, and not worry about losing a lens. Also, contact lenses may protect you from the above mentioned problems, but they actually increase the risk of one getting an infection from microorganisms in the water.Therefore, swimming goggles can protect your eyes from these ailments. Also, when swimming outdoors, swim goggles can protect your eyes from ultraviolet radiation, and they can also have a tinted lens to shield you from the sun. If you wear a prescription, swim goggles can be fit with your prescription in them to help you see underwater.</p>
<p>Here's what to look for:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ultraviolet Protection:</b> If you are swimming outdoors, make sure your goggle protects you from ultraviolet radiation. (For more on UV, see UV and its Effects on the Eyes).</li>
	
	<li><b>Proper Seal:</b> The most important thing is selecting a goggle is a proper seal. For a goggle to properly work, it must create a good seal so water cannot seep into the goggle. You want the goggle to fit on the bone around the eyes, not inside the eye socket itself. An improperly fit goggle will cause "raccoon eyes". This is because the goggle rests on the socket, instead of the bone, and cuts off circulation. Also, the goggle must seal completely. Put the goggle on and make sure you can see no visible gaps between the goggle and your face. If making a prescription in the lens, you may want to take the goggle home first, and make sure it seals properly before you go through the expense of a prescription lens.</li>
	
	<li><b>Lens Color:</b> If swimming outdoors, you may want to put a slight tint in the lens to help block the amount of sunlight getting to your eyes. A smoke lens is still light enough to see underwater, but can block enough light so you don't have to squint.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="free">Freestyle</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Head – In-line with spine</li>
	<li>Eyes – Looking at bottom of pool when not breathing, looking sideways, one eye directly 
	over/above the other while breathing.</li>
	<li>Shoulders and chest – Rotate around central axis of spine in the same plane as hips. 
	High shoulder is on recovery arm side, the low one is on the pulling arm side.</li>
	<li>Arms – One arm tends to be leading at all times, other arm is pulling or recovering; 
	more of a catch-up with hands overlapping in the area from shoulders forward – 
	sometimes called the front end or front quadrant. Shorter max-effort or sprint-efforts 
	may have less front-end overlap, even no front-end overlap but that is a function of the 
	timing. Not an effort to remove the overlap.</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand pull – Propulsive surface, line from fingertips up through wrist and 
	elbow should be pointing at the bottom of the pool as much of the time as possible – as 
	early as a catch can be achieved with the maximum possible catch held until the hand 
	passes below the waist</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand recovery – Relaxed, hanging from the elbow, swung forward rather 
	than pushed forward, thumb leading</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand entry – Fingertip first, rotated thumb up, pinky first entry, then a 
	gentle slide forward to a natural extension as the body rotates</li>
	<li>Trunk – Must maintain the connection between shouders and hips</li>
	<li>Hips – Rotate around central axis of spine in the same plane as shoulders</li>
	<li>Attempt to initiate body rotation from hips</li>
	<li>Legs – Kick is secondary to the pull, not overpowering it. It should be natural, not forced. 
	A variety of kick rhythms are acceptable, from 2-beat through 6-beat, with cross-over 
	variations.</li>
	<li>Feet – Faster feet = faster pull = faster swim if same kick pattern is maintained (2-beat, 
	6-beat etc.). Switching from a lower beat kick to a higher one will also result in faster arms and a faster swim, but possibly at a higher cost if not practiced often. Splashing is 
	not only OK but also encouraged to facilitate better follow-through on the kick.</li>
	<li>Breathing – Every 2 or 3 pulls – every 1 or 1.5 cycles. Swimmers must be equally 
	comfortable breathing to either side, May breathe less often for shorter events.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4 id="back">Backstroke</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Head – In-line with spine</li>
	<li>Eyes – Looking straight up in longer events and slightly back towards feet in 
	shorter events</li>
	<li>Shoulders and chest – Rotate around central axis of spine in same plane as hips. 
	High shoulder is on recovery arm side, low shoulder on pulling arm side</li>
	<li>Arms – Arms are always 180 degrees to each other. Arm speed is controlled by 
	kick speed. Recovery arm is straight from wrist to shoulder and points straight 
	up</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand pull – Propulsive surface, line from fingertips through wrist and elbow starts pointing towards the bottom and side of the pool, rotates more towards the side and surface of the pool, then finishes releasing the water towards the feet and under the hips; reach towards the bottom, then arm-wrestle, then throw something in your pocket</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand recovery – Straight arm from shoulder to wrist</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand entry – Pinky first, directly above and just outside the 
	shoulder with arm fully extended, with body rotation allowing entry hand to 
	reach deep into the catch</li>
	<li>Trunk – Must maintain the connection between the shoulders and the hips</li>
	<li>Hips – Rotate around central axis of spine in same plane as shoulders</li>
	<li>Attempt to initiate body rotation from the hips</li>
	<li>Legs – Kick is steady 6-beat, with faster tempo resulting in faster hands</li>
	<li>Feet – Faster feet = faster pull = faster swim. Boiling water at toes is not only 
	OK but encouraged to facilitate better follow-through on the kick</li>
	<li>Breathing – One breath per cycle; inhale on one pull, exhale on the next pull</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4 id="breast">Breaststroke</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Head – Varies slightly, but primarily in-line with spine</li>
	<li>Eyes – Looking at the bottom of the pool when not breathing, looking down and 
	forward when breathing</li>
	<li>Shoulders and chest – Tip up and down/forward about a line drawn from one hip to 
	the other. Shoulders also lift and squeeze in towards ears as elbows come together 
	and hands/arms move forward in recovery</li>
	<li>Arms – Arms are a mirror of each other. Arm speed controls foot speed, and rhythm 
	will generally change during the course of a race, with the highest tempo occurring 
	during the first and last portion of a race.</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand pull – Propulsive surface starts as hand through shoulder as the 
	arms sweep out and up, then changes to hands through elbow as hands sweep 
	towards each other as elbows squeeze together</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand recovery – Hands lead forward at or under the surface of the 
	water, reaching forward; as the extend the upper body lowers forward and onto or 
	under the water, but avoid a diving down action</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand entry – Full extension, hands touching each other at the thumb</li>
	<li>Trunk – Must maintain the connection between shoulders and hips</li>
	<li>Hips – Hips are driven forward and under trunk by pull and by back muscles, then 
	become an anchor point as upper body launches forward with no pause as kick is 
	initiated.</li>
	<li>Hips remain relatively high in water, acting as a moving-forward pivot point</li>
	<li>Legs – Fast motion of ankles both up and towards the hips (kick recovery) and 
	through the kick action (back and slightly out to full extension)• Feet – Foot rhythm controlled by pull speed; feet must always move fast – foot speed always high, in both directions; kick concludes with legs in full extension, soles of feet pressing together</li>
	<li>Breathing – One breath per cycle, as hands and elbows sweep in, trunk rises, breath 
	taken from when mouth clears until trunk begins to lower.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4 id="butterfly">Butterfly</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Head - Varies slightly, but primarily in-line with spine</li>
	<li>Eyes - Looking at bottom of bool when not breathing, looking down and forward when 
	breathing</li>
	<li>Shoulders and chest – Tip up and down/forward about a line drawn from one hip 
	through the other. The chest lays forward and presses down as the hands enter.</li>
	<li>Arms – Arms are a mirror of each other. Arm speed controls rhythm, with generally 
	steady to decreasing/slowing rhythm through the course of a race unless well 
	conditioned.</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand pull – Arms remain shoulder width apart, flex at elbows with line 
	from fingertips through elbow moving towards, pointing down and slightly inward, then 
	sweep inwards to outwards they press on the water, with the fingertip through elbow 
	line moving from pointing inwards and down to slightly outwards and down</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand recovery – Straight arms, relaxed hands, with a wide and low arm 
	swing, thumb down, pinky up, back of the hand towards thumb lead.</li>
	<li>Forearm and hand entry – Straight arms, extended, thumb to fingertip first, shoulder 
	width apart</li>
	<li>Trunk – Must maintain the connection between shoulders and hips</li>
	<li>Hips – Maintain hips relatively high in water, acting as a moving forward pivot point</li>
	<li>Legs – Generally two kicks per cycle, but one per cycle is also acceptable. Timing is 
	based on arm timing, with kick balancing arm and trunk motion. There is generally a kick 
	as the pull begins and second kick just prior to the hand exit. The kick action and the 
	chest position must together or swimmer will be moving body up and down instead of 
	forward. If swimmer attempts to kick with too much effort they will tire sooner than if 
	they allow the kick to work with the arms and body</li>
	<li>Feet – Feet must remain in the same plane throughout the entire kick. They may be in 
	slightly different planes, but that difference should not change. Feet are extended, 
	relaxed ankle on the down beat, flexed on the upbeat. Kick amplitude should not be 
	exaggerated</li>
	<li>Breathing – Keeping body as low and flat/forward as possible, head tips up enough for face top clear water, inhale, head lays down prior to arm recovery reaching a “T” from the shoulders out to the fingertips</li>

<h4 id="physics">Physics behind swimming</h4>

<p>Of all the possible ways for us to get from here to there under our own power, swimming is by far the least efficient.</p>
<p>Sure, we can float, tread water or paddle on our backs with relative ease. But to move through water at even a slow walking pace requires significantly more energy. In fact, world champion swimmers can barely travel at 5 miles per hour, whereas a suitably motivated dolphin can hit 25 mph. </p>
<p>Here are two articles outlining the scientific principles behind swimming</p>
