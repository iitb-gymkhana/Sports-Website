									<p>The Government of India, through its National Sports Organization, provides a scheme in all IITs, where all incoming, i.e. first year students, must sign up for a particular sport, and undergo training.</p>

The fundamental skills of all students are built upon in these one and half hour sessions twice a week along with development in advanced game-play skills and fitness. NSO has been the starting point of many Inter-IIT players.</p>
