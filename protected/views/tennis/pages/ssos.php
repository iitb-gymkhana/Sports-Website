			<li><h4>Where are the tennis courts located?</h4></li>

				<p>IIT Bombay boasts six hard courts located next to H11 near the Staff Hostel inside the campus.</p>

				<li><h4>What all things do I need to bring to the courts for SSoS?<h4></li>

				<p>Compulsory/Strongly recommended: Tennis racquet, proper tennis attire which includes shorts/trackpants, t-shirt and non-marking shoes
				Recommended: Towel, water-bottle, skipping rope
				Balls will be provided at the courts.</li>


				<li><h4>Is it compulsory to have a personal tennis racquet? What if I do not have one?</h4></li>

				<p>Not compulsory, but it is strongly recommended to have one. You might need it for practice beyond the hours of the camp as well.
					There are few racquets which can be issued at the tennis courts on first come first serve basis OR you may issue it from your respective hostel OR you can borrow it from any of your friend.</p>

					<li><h4>What are some good racquet brands? How much should I expect to pay?</h4></li>

					<p>Wilson, Head, Babolat, Yonex and Prince are some of the pioneer racquet brands in tennis.
As a beginner, it will cost you around 1500 to 3000 bucks to buy a good racquet for learning tennis. Make sure that it’s a full sized racquet (27 inches length) before ordering it.
For more details on how to select a racquet click here, although it’s not necessary to go into too much of the details mentioned as a beginner.</p>

				<li><h4>What are some good sports shops nearby IITB/websites to buy tennis equipments?</h4></li>

				<p>Sports Shops: Selection Centre Sports (Heera Panna Shopping Centre, Powai) is a good place to buy sports equipments at discounted rates. It is open from 10:00 am to 9:00 pm on all days of the week.
					You can reach them at this number: +91-22 2570 8712
					Online:<a href = "www.tennishub.in">www.tennishub.in</a> is a good website with highly discounted tennis equipments available for ordering online. It’s good to explore stuff and read reviews by people who’ve bought those items before.</p>




					<li><h4>What kind of footwear is allowed at the tennis courts?</h4></li>

						<p>Only flat soled non-marking shoes OR gum-soled shoes are allowed. Running shoes are strictly not permitted.
Guide: Gum soled shoes are generally cheaper than non-marking tennis shoes and can be put to multipurpose use in badminton, squash courts as well. But they last for a lesser time than the non marking tennis shoes. Time to think! ;)</p>


					<li><h4>Is the registration fee refundable?</h4></li>

					<p>The registration fee of INR 500 is non-refundable without any exceptions.</p>


					<li><h4>Is it possible to change the time slot?</h4></li>

					<p>Sorry, the time slots cannot be changed once you’ve registered for a batch.</p>

					<li><h4>Some of my non-IITB friends are interested in registering for SSoS. Are they eligible?</h4></li>

					<p>No, non-IITB residents are not eligible to register for the Summer School of Sports training sessions. We are sorry, but no exceptions can be made.</p>

					<li><h4>I have registered as an intermediate but I’m not sure if I qualify to be one?</h4></li>

					<p>Don’t worry, the coach will accordingly change your batch if the need arises after the first week of the camp.</p>
