									<h3  style="color:#FCC72C">Camps</h3>
									<p>Every summer, by popular demand, our coach, Dr. P. M. Reddy, holds camps in swimming at the beginners, intermediate and advanced levels. Camps are also held for IIT students during the semester.</p>

			<p>The beginners camps are held separately for children, ladies, students and staff.
			The duration is normally 15-20 days, and there is a demonstration for parents and families on the last day, when certificates are handed out.</p>
			<p>The Intermediate camp is open to anyone who has completed the prescribed 40 laps in the beginners. In this camp, they are taught, the breaststroke, the butterfly stroke and the backstroke.</p>
			<p>The advanced swimming camp is a year round affair, 6 days a week, throughout the year, with 2 sessions a day in the summer. To qualify for the advanced camp, one must be able to do 2000 metres of freestyle in a certain amount of time.</p>
			
			<p>Our club also holds water polo camp to train the students for water polo.</p>

									<h3  style="color:#FCC72C">NSO</h3>
									<p>The Government of India, through its National Sports Organization, provides a scheme in all IITs, where all incoming, i.e. first year students, must sign up for a particular sport, and undergo training. This scheme, popularly called NSO, is available to IIT students for training in various sports, such as swimming, hockey, basketball, squash, badminton, tennis, athletics, table tennis, football etc. </p>
			<p>Swimming, is a much sought after option, and since the number of students that can be accommodated in a given sport is limited, it is not surprising to see students, at the beginning of every academic year, crowding around the coach at the poolside, to give their trials and try to get in. </p>
			<p>What is extremely encouraging, is that students often develop a new interest in swimming, and continue to attend advanced coaching throughout the year, all through their college life, and not just the first year. </p>
			<p>The NSO swim training functions two evenings a week, and each session stretches to a couple of hours.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>The NSO timings are:</h4>
			<p>MONDAY and WEDNESDAY 	6:00 pm - 8:00 pm</p>
